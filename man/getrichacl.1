.TH GETRICHACL 7 2015-09-01 "Linux" "Rich Access Control Lists"

.SH NAME
getrichacl \- Get Rich Access Control Lists

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B getrichacl
.RI [ OPTION "]... [" FILE ]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
For each file, getrichacl displays the file name and Rich Access Control List
(richacl).

By default, richacl displays the effective permissions remaining after applying
the file masks to the ACL, and does not display the file masks. When the file
masks and underlying NFSv4 ACL are relevant, the \-\-raw option should be used.

The output format of getrichacl is as follows:
.fam C
.RS
.nf
 1:  file:
 2:      flags:a
 3:      owner:rwp-------------::mask
 4:      group:r-p-------------::mask
 5:      other:r---------------::mask
 6:     owner@:rwp-------------::allow
 7:        foo:r-p-------------::allow
 8:     group@:r-p-------------::allow
 9:        bar:r-p-------------:g:allow
10:  everyone@:r---------------::allow
11:
.fi
.RE
.fam T

Line 1 contains the file name, followed by a colon.

Line 2 contains the ACL flags. This line is omitted if no flags are set.

Lines 3--5 indicate the owner, group, and other file masks, which are only
shown if the \-\-raw option is specified.

Lines 6--10 indicate different ACL entries for the file owner
.RB ( owner@ ),
user foo, the owning group
.RB ( group@ ),
for group bar, and for everyone
.RB ( everyone@ ).

At the end, a blank line is displayed.

By default, getrichacl displays the the single-letter forms of flags and
permissions, the identifiers of ACL entryies are right justified, the
permissions are vertically aligned, and permissions which are always
granted
.RB ( read_attributes ", " read_acl ", " synchronize )
are omitted. See the richacl(7) manual page for the defined flags and
permissions.

When getrichacl is used on a file that does not have a richacl or on a
filesystem that does not support richacls, getrichacl displays the access
permissions defined by the traditional file permission bits. When getrichacl is
used on a file that has a POSIX ACL, it prints an error message.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-long\fR, \fB\-l\fR
Display access masks and flags in their long form.
.TP
\fB\-\-full\fR
Also show permissions which are always implicitly allowed.
.TP
\fB\-\-raw\fR
Show acls as stored on the file system including the file masks. Implies
\fB\-\-full\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-unaligned\fR
Do not align ACL entries or pad missing permissions with '-'.
.TP
\fB\-\-numeric-ids\fR
Display numeric user and group IDs instead of names.

Instead of the ACL, show which permissions the caller or a specified user has
for file(s).  When a list of groups is given, this overrides the groups the
user is in.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR, \fB\-v\fR
Display the version of getrichacl and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR, \fB\-h\fR
