.TH SETRICHACL 7 2015-09-01 "Linux" "Rich Access Control Lists"

.SH NAME
setrichacl \- Set Rich Access Control Lists

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B setrichacl
.RI [ option "]... [" file ]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B setrichacl
utility sets or modifies Rich Access Control Lists (richacls) of files and
directories.

The
.B \-m
and
.B \-s
options expect an ACL or parts of an ACL on the command line. The
.B \-M
and
.B \-S
options read an ACL or parts of an ACL from a file. In either case, the entry
format is described in section
.I TEXT FORM
of the
.BR richacl (7)
manual page. The single-letter or long forms of flags and permissions can be
mixed arbitrarily. Multiple entries are separated by whitespace, newlines or
commas.

Note that the order of ACL entries matters, and that changing the order may
grant different permissions.

The use of
.B deny
entries is discouraged. If
.B deny
entries are used, they should be placed ahead of
.B allow
entries for improved interoperability with Windows where possible.

When the file masks are not specified, they are computed automatically.

When the ACL to be set is simple enough that the traditional file permission
bits can express the same permissions,
.B setrichacl
instead only sets the file permission bits. Minor differences that do not have
an influence on the permissions granted by the ACL are not preserved.  When
.BR setrichacl 's
counterpart utility,
.BR getrichacl (1),
is used on a file or directory that does not have a richacl, it displays the
access permissions defined by the file permission bits as a richacl.

.SS Permissions

Setting ACLs or changing the file permission bits is allowed to the file owner,
to processes which have the
.B write_acl
permission, and to processes which have the
.B CAP_FOWNER
capability.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-modify\fR \fIacl\fR, \fB\-m\fR \fIacl\fR
Modify the ACL of \fIfile\fR by replacing existing entries with the entries in
\fIacl\fR, and adding all new entries. When the permissions of an entry are
empty, remove the entry.
.TP
\fB\-\-modify\-file\fR \fIacl_file\fR, \fB\-M\fR \fIacl_file\fR
Identical to \fB\-\-modify\fR, but read the ACL from \fIacl_file\fR instead. If
the file is \(lq\-\(rq, read from standard input.
.TP
\fB\-\-set\fR \fIacl\fR, \fB\-s\fR \fIacl\fR
Set the ACL of \fIfile\fR to \fIacl\fR. Any previous ACL is replaced.
ACL entries are separated by whitespace, newlines, or commas.
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-file\fR \fIacl_file\fR, \fB\-S\fR \fIacl_file\fR
Identical to \fB\-\-set\fR, but read the ACL from \fIacl_file\fR instead. If
the file is \(lq\-\(rq, read from standard input.
.TP
\fB\-\-remove\fR, \fB\-b\fR
Remove all extended permissions and revert to the file permission bits only.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR, \fB\-v\fR
Display the version of
.B setrichacl
and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR, \fB\-h\fR
Display command-line usage help text.
